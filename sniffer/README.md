# Network Sniffer

In order to test out this project, we need to implement a network sniffer.

## What Is Sniffing?
Network Sniffing is the act of recording the network traffic on a specific network interface card.

Tools like [tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/) and [npcap](https://npcap.com/) are the best known examples for network sniffing tools.
npcap is commonly used with [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) in order to get a simple user interface to analyze the packets.

Network sniffing is used to view, analyze and gain a better understanding about the devices network traffic.
